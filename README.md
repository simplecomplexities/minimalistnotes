# Minimalist Notes

## Overview

A simple note-taking application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that
allows users to add, organize, and manage notes.

The HTML is written in a really simple way, so you can create your own Status
messages for the toggle bar, and Categories are automatically generated when you
type one, automatically deleting the categories when you delete all notes
related to it.

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model
developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT did all the javascript code, and I did the structure
and design code. We argued. We solved problems.


## Please Note

This is a very simple note system, so a few things to consider and remember:
- If you create a note of the same name as an existing note, it will overwrite
the existing one with your ned content.
- If you write a bunch of stuff and don't hit save and refresh, it will
overwrite the note with a blank page.
- Because the notes are locally stored in your browser, you need to periodically
create a backup to ensure that clearing your browser cache doesn't delete it
permanently.
- ChatGPT told me that it can keep between 5,000 and 10,000 notes without
breaking your computer.
